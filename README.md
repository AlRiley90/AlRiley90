- âš¡:libra: Fun fact: I love to spend my spare time watching movies, discovering a new show on some streaming platform, reading a book about someone influential, and have recently discovered that I have a true passion for coding. I enjoy the feeling of knowing that people can see and interact with my work, however, I do have a pretty thorough understanding of several backend languages. Every chance I get to learn something new I want to take advantage of.
